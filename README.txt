Content Construction Kit
------------------------
For information about the CCK, see http://drupal.org/cck-status

This is still in development. Do not use on production sites.

To test, add cck.mysql to your database. Place the cck folder
into your modules directory. Go to administer -> modules and enable
the content and field modules (optionally, list.module).

Now go to administer -> content -> content types. Create a new
content type and edit it to add some fields. Then test by
creating a new node of your new type.
