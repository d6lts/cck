UPDATING FROM VERSION 4.7 to 6.x
================================================================

THERE IS NO DIRECT UPGRADE PATH FROM 4.7 TO 6.x!! FIRST UPGRADE
YOUR DATABASE FROM 4.7 TO THE LATEST 5.x VERSION, THEN UPGRADE
TO 6.x.

ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING!

1) While 4.7 is still installed, upload the latest 4.7 version of
   all the CCK files, go to update.php, and run all possible
   updates for the Content module and all field modules.

2) Install Drupal version 5. Once it is running, upload and install
   the latest 5.x versions of all CCK modules, go to update.php and
   run all possible updates.

3) Install Drupal version 6. Once it is running, upload and install
   the latest 6.x versions of all CCK modules, go to update.php and
   run all possible updates.

Your database should now be ready to run in CCK version 6.x

================================================================
UPDATING FROM VERSION 5.x to 6.x
================================================================

YOU MUST RUN ALL POSSIBLE UPDATES TO YOUR DATABASE IN 5.x USING 
THE LATEST 5.x CODE, BEFORE UPGRADING FROM 5.x to 6.x.

ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING!

1) Before upgrading to 6.x, upload the latest 5.x versions of all 
   CCK modules, go to update.php and run all possible updates.

2) Install Drupal version 6. Once it is running, upload and install
   the latest 6.x versions of all CCK modules, go to update.php and
   run all possible updates.

Your database should now be ready to run in CCK version 6.x

================================================================

These steps are necessary because of significant changes in the 
database structure between the 4.7 and 6.x versions. These changes
make it extremely difficult to create an automatic upgrade path that 
will work reliably in every possible situation.
