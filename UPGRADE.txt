Updating the content module from 4.7 to 5.x

The 4.7 version of the content module created a table called node_type to track 
the custom node types that were created in CCK. In Drupal 5.x, that table is 
created and maintained as a core file. The most recent 4.7 versions include an 
update to rename the content module version of this table so that the upgrade to
5.x will be able to create it's own version of that table. 

If you are running the the most recent 4.7 content module version and have performed
all possible updates in 4.7, you should have no trouble updating to 5.0. However, if 
your version of 4.7 is not up to date, you may get error messages when you update 
to 5.x when the core installation tries to create that table. 

There are two ways to handle the update if you are not running the latest 4.7 version:

OPTION #1

Before updating your site to Drupal 5.x, download the latest version of the 
4.7 content module and upload it to your site, then go to update.php and run all 
required updates. Check that the updates worked correctly, then go ahead and upgrade 
to 5.0 as explained in the UPGRADE.txt file in the 5.0 installation files. If you do this, 
you should see no errors related to the node_type table when you do the update.


OPTION #2

Go ahead and update to 5.0 without first updating the 4.7 version. This will
save you the time of downloading and updating your 4.7 version, but if you do it
this way you may see errors when you do the 5.x update that say that the node_type
table already exists. You can ignore those errors because the content module update,
which runs after those errors are generated, will update your tables and rerun
the failed core update to create the table properly.
